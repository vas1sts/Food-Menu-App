# Food Menu App with Xamarin.Forms

## Description

This mobile application is a simple menu for selecting food items and triggering their preparation asynchronously. 

## Features

- Displays a list of food items using a CollectionView.
- Allows users to select food items from the list.
- Initiates asynchronous preparation of the selected food item.
- Includes a "Cancel" button to stop food preparation.

## Technologies Used

- Xamarin.Forms
- C#

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the app on your preferred device or emulator.
4. Select a food item from the list.
5. Wait for the selected food item to be prepared.
6. Use the "Cancel" button to stop food preparation if needed.

## How It Works

- The app uses Xamarin.Forms to create a user interface with a CollectionView to display food items.
- When a user selects a food item, the app triggers an asynchronous process to prepare that item.
- The "Cancel" button allows users to interrupt the food preparation process.
